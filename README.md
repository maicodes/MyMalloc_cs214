# MyMalloc_cs214
In this project, we will write a C library which implements a better version of the system's dynamic memory functions malloc() and free(). Dealing with dynamic memory is cumbersome because the system only outputs segment faults without further explanation when users make mistake. It can create lots of frustration for users since they have no insight about what is wrong with their applications. The new malloc() and free() functions will not only handle the essential functionality of the system malloc library, but will also detect common programming and usage errors that may occur when working with dynamic memory.
